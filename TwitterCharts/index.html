<div class='description'>
	<h3>
	On the 6th of Janurary 2021, the United States Capitol
	Building in Washington, D.C was stormed during a riot 
	and violent attack against the U.S Congress (Reeves, 
	Mascaro, Woodward, 2021). This event was fueled over 
	the several months in the lead up to Janurary 2021, heating up during 
	the US elections on the 4th of November 2020. 
	This article will analyse the impact and influence
	Trump’s Twitter had on the Capitol riots.

		Donald Trump addressed a crowd south of the

		heard." However he also told his supporters to
		"fight like hell, and if you don't fight 
		like hell, you're not going to have a country 
		anymore.” This was the last warning to the US 
		Capitol building before Trump and his supporters 
		were “going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue… 
		and we're going to the Capitol" (Sardarizadeh, 
		Lussenhop, 2021). Hours after his speech Trump 
		tweeted, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage”, 
		and at the same time Pence was evacuated from 
		the Capitol Building as the riots had already 
		started. The tweet on the right was Trump’s 
		final tweet on the evening of the 6th. He states 
		to “Remember this day forever”, ignoring the 
		violence that had just insured on the Capitol 
		Building and insinuating to his followers 
		that this day was a momentous day to 
		remember. Both of these tweets were deleted by Twitter 
		and Trump’s account was given a 12 hour 
		suspension (Hamilton, 2021). However, this was too late as 
		the damage was already done. Twitter had 
		also faced widespread pressure to 
		permanently ban Donald Trumps Twitter 
		account, which they did on the 8th of 
		Janurary 2021.
